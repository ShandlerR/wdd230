    <h1>Chamber Site Plan - Shandler Rechenberger</h1>

    <!-- SITE NAME -->
    <section>
        <h2>Site Name: "Commerce Chamber: Stroudsburg"</h2>
        <p>
            Reasoning: I chose these words Very Carefully. First of all, I wanted to keep it as short as possible, while still getting acorss all the details. 
            Second, I know that the user needs to know two things upfront, What the site represents (The Chamber of Commerce), and for where (Stroudsburg, PA). I left out 
            the ", PA" Part due to it adding extra characters, and looking ugly up top. 
        </p>

    <!-- SITE PURPOSE -->
    <section>
        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            I think the reading material provides a pretty good explanation for what this site hopes to achieve. First, we need a way to promote the area (Stroudsburg, PA) 
            so that people will intially be attracted to this area. Second, we need to show some local businesses (Maybe even pricing) for the average man. However, the main 
            point of a site like this is to help businesses network with one another. Therefore, there needs to be a way to connect with other business owners, and join or host
            events.

    <!-- SCENARIOS  -->
    <section>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p>
            A Chamber of Commerce site is made for anyone who wants to interact with the local community, which could be toursts, business owners, or community members. A few
            Questions that may be asked by this group are:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>What are some local hotspots (Places where people can explore)?</li>
            <li>What are some of the local businesses, and what are their prices (Can be achieved with website link)?</li>
            <li>How can I meet up with fellow business owners?</li>
            <li>What activites are being held, and where, by the community?</li>
        </ol>

    <!-- COLOR SCHEMA -->
    <section>
        <h2>Color Schema</h2>
        <img width="100%" src="images/chamber-colors.png" alt="Chamber Site Plan Colors, which consist of 1 dark shade of green, and 4 lighter shades of green.">
        <p>
            My Reasoning for choosing colors that revolve around green is because PA is literally a forest with buildings inside of it. My next thought was that I wanted colors
            That showed off the vibrancy of the trees. I think that "Pear" will be used as accent colors, and either Sea green, Pigment Green, or Dark green will be used as background colors.
            and then perhaps Pigment green will be used for Important text colors (such as headings). These are due to change as the site get laid out.
